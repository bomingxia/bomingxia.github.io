  abstract = {The increase of software supply chain threats has underscored the necessity for robust security mechanisms, among which the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) stands out as a promising solution. SBOMs, by providing a machine-readable inventory of software composition details, play a crucial role in enhancing transparency and traceability within software supply chains. This empirical study delves into the practical challenges and solutions associated with the adoption of SBOMs through an analysis of 4,786 GitHub discussions across 510 SBOM-related projects. Through repository mining and analysis, this research delineates key topics, challenges, and solutions intrinsic to the effective utilization of SBOMs. Furthermore, we shed light on commonly used tools and frameworks for SBOM generation, exploring their respective strengths and limitations. This study underscores a set of findings, for example, there are four phases of the SBOM life cycle, and each phase has a set of SBOM development activities and issues; in addition, this study emphasizes the role SBOM play in ensuring resilient software development practices and the imperative of their widespread adoption and integration to bolster supply chain security. The insights of our study provide vital input for future work and practical advancements in this topic.},

  abstract = {The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has underscored the urgent need for responsible AI practices. Despite increasing interest, a comprehensive AI risk assessment toolkit remains lacking. This study introduces our Responsible AI (RAI) Question Bank, a comprehensive framework and tool designed to support diverse AI initiatives. By integrating AI ethics principles such as fairness, transparency, and accountability into a structured question format, the RAI Question Bank aids in identifying potential risks, aligning with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act, and enhancing overall AI governance. A key benefit of the RAI Question Bank is its systematic approach to linking lower-level risk questions to higher-level ones and related themes, preventing siloed assessments and ensuring a cohesive evaluation process. Case studies illustrate the practical application of the RAI Question Bank in assessing AI projects, from evaluating risk factors to informing decision-making processes. The study also demonstrates how the RAI Question Bank can be used to ensure compliance with standards, mitigate risks, and promote the development of trustworthy AI systems. This work advances RAI by providing organizations with a valuable tool to navigate the complexities of ethical AI development and deployment while ensuring comprehensive risk management.},

This study examines how leading companies align RAI with their ESG goals. Through interviews with 28 industry leaders, we identified a strong link between RAI and ESG practices. However, a significant gap exists between internal RAI policies and public disclosures, highlighting the need for greater board-level expertise, robust governance, and employee engagement. We provide key recommendations to strengthen RAI strategies, focusing on transparency, cross-functional collaboration, and seamless integration into existing ESG frameworks.},
