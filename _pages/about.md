 I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Responsible AI Research Centre, affiliated with the Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML), Adelaide University. My research focuses on **operationalizing safe and responsible AI** from a **system-level perspective**, integrating methods from software engineering and AI governance. My recent research interests include the safety of foundation model-based agents.
